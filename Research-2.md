**1. NutriClean® HepatoCleanse**

*Composition & Traditional Use:*

* **Milk Thistle (Silybum marianum):** Traditionally used for liver ailments due to its active compound, silymarin, known for antioxidant properties.
* **Turmeric (Curcuma longa):** Contains curcumin, which has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for its anti-inflammatory effects.

*Scientific Evidence:*

* **Milk Thistle:** Some studies suggest silymarin may have hepatoprotective effects, but results are mixed, and more rigorous clinical trials are needed.
* **Turmeric/Curcumin:** Research indicates potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits, but bioavailability is a concern; formulations enhancing absorption are under study.
