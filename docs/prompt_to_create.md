Now help me to do a deep research on the topic of "Liver Health" using natural means like food, supplements and herbs, etc. Please advise me as an expert on Naturopathy and Nutrition. I need to give a formal presentation on this topic. Be thorough in your research.

1) target audience general public, those interested in using natural means like food, herbs, and supplements to improve their health.  
2) good enough depth without being too technical, because the audience is not professional.  
3) more towards Western accepted norms.  
4) Include recent scientific studies to supplement traditional knowledge/wisdom.  
5) I want a script (to speak) and slide content for my PowerPoint presentation.
